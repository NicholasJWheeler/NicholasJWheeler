## 🙋🏼‍♂️ About Me
I was born in Columbus, Ohio, and have lived in Dublin, Ohio for my whole life. Early on in my childhood, I fixed a network issue on my family's home computer and I have loved working with technology ever since. In high school, I took two years of programming through College Credit Plus courses and worked on Python, HTML, and GameMaker projects; all of which I greatly enjoyed. Since then I have worked on personal projects as well as many professional projects for college courses. Along with majoring in computer science at college, I am minoring in games and simulation as I would like to develop a game of my own one day. Feel free to browse any projects I have featured on my page, and don't hesitate to reach out and ask any questions!

<h4> Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (2025)</h4>

Miami University, located in Oxford, Ohio, is a prominent public research university known for its academic excellence and picturesque campus. Established in 1809, it is one of the oldest universities in the United States. Despite its name, it is not located in Miami, Florida, but rather in the charming college town of Oxford, which is around 35 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio. I am currently attending [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) on Miami's main campus.

 - [View a formal course description here.](https://miamioh-sa.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=11908)
 - I took this course while on a faculty-led CSE study-abroad trip to the University of Calabria in Italy
 - This course utilized the declarative programming language DLV (Datalog with Disjunction) which was partially developed at the University of Calabria
 - Complex problems such as the Knight's Tour, Sudoku, Binario, and the 3-colorability problem were able to be easily solved utilizing DLV
 - Since DLV is based on Datalog, it produces answer sets as the result by following "rules" set in the code
